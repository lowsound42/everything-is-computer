# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile


# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.  To use
# your own domain name with automatic HTTPS, ensure your A/AAAA DNS record is
# pointing to this machine's public IP, then replace `http://` with your domain
# name.  Refer to the documentation for full instructions on the address
# specification.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses
#http:// {

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
 #   root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
  #  file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    # php_fastcgi localhost:9000

    # Refer to the directive documentation for more options.
    # https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives
